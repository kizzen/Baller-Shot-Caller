#Step 1 - pulling games from an old github commit and downloading all the files as JSON. 
#Date: 1 April 17
#Comment:
    + Dependency question: module functions that are dependent on each other---
        what happens when you just pull one?
    + Need to automatically put the downloaded games into a predefined folder using OS.
